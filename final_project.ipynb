    "## Report Noisy Max Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Report Noisy Max (RNM) is a selection algorithm, which is an algorithm that finds the kth smallest value in a list. RNM is used to return the approximate maximizer and 2nd maximizer. According to the paper, RNM can also return the \"noisy gap\" between the approximate maximizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of queries, RNM returns the identity (not value) of the query that is likely to have the largest value -- adds noise to each query answer and returns the index of the query with the largest noisy value. It accomplishes this by using a mechanism, an algorithm that supports differential privacy. In RNM according to the papers, Laplace Mechanism is used as it adds the _right_ amount of noise to satisfy differential privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea:\n",
    "1. For each case in a set, compute a noisy score using Laplace Mechanism\n",
    "2. Output the element in the set with the maximum noisy score\n",
